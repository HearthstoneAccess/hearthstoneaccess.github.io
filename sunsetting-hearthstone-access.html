		<h1>Sunsetting Hearthstone Access</h1>

		<p>Hello everyone. Guide Dev here.</p>

		<p>After a year and a half of Hearthstone Access, I'm sad to announce that version 24.6 will be the last major version of Hearthstone I'll be able to support.</p>

		<p>I'm hoping to release 24.6 later today so you'll still be able to play for a while longer. However, once the next major patch lands, I will no longer be updating Hearthstone Access to work with the newer version. I'm not entirely sure on when that'll be, but I'm assuming it'll happen on a Tuesday between now and December 6 as that's the planned release date for the new expansion.</p>

		<p>I know a lot of players will be sad to hear this. Please know that I am sad too and that I do not make this decision lightly. I deeply appreciate the community built around Hearthstone Access and I hope you've enjoyed playing the game over these past 15 months as much as I've enjoyed watching everyone play it.</p>

		<p>This was the first time I worked on anything accessibility-wise and I truly loved the process. Watching someone play and interact with a blind-accessible interface you've just designed for the first time as a sighted developer is immensely rewarding. I really hope Hearthstone Access serves as an example of how even complex, chaotic games such as Battlegrounds can be made blind-accessible - and fun - for many years to come.</p>

		<p>Having said that, carrying Hearthstone Access on my back all this time has become increasingly difficult and the time has come for me to take a step back. I really, <strong>really</strong> hate to be doing this, but the last few months have been extremely busy and I've been seriously struggling to keep up with everything.</p>

		<p>Hearthstone Access has been suffering with this as well as I simply don't have as much time as I once had to devote to it. With all the recent (and upcoming) changes, it's gotten to a point where I think Hearthstone Access is just getting worse with every patch (while Hearthstone itself is getting better). This was never the intention - and I'm really not happy with it.</p>

		<p>I'll see if I can write a proper retrospective at some point. For now though, I just wanted to give everyone a heads up as I know a lot of players depend on me updating Hearthstone Access in order to play the game and I don't want people to be pre-purchasing content for the new expansion if they don't have other means of accessing it.</p>

		<p>Thanks for all the support.</p>
